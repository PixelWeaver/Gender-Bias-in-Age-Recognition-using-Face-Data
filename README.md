# Gender Bias in Age Recognition using Face Data

## Goal
Our goal is to highlight once more the gender bias appearing naturally in Neural Networks, this time in the context of age recognition using face data. After demonstrating its impact and discussing its origin, we will attempt to develop methodologies to counter its influence on the output of deep convolutional neural networks.

## Dataset
We will be relying on the the [OUI-Adience Face Image Project](https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html?fbclid=IwAR3oevRX2opUvkx6Iome4SCFYEvYsFoXbUva_uQGgZVafQ__TyEU2LkjyN8) to train, validate and test our architecture.
